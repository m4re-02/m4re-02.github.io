            standard, the HTML Living Standard is developed by WHATWG, which is
            made up of the major browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and
            Microsoft), with the Living Standard also existing in an abridged

            HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,
            with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
            Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest
            multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily
            readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
            devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's
            rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software.
            HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and
            DOM Level 2 HTML.

            HTML 5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more
            interoperable implementations; it extends, improves and rationalizes
            the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and
            application programming interfaces (APIs) for complex web
            applications. For the same reasons, HTML 5 is also a candidate for
            cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features
            designed with low-powered devices in mind.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
            Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable
            the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
            colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
            accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the
            specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web
            pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
            separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the
            structural content.

            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to
            present the same markup page in different styles for different
            rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
            speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile
            devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content
            is accessed on a mobile device.

            Sass (Syntactically awesome style sheets) is a style sheet language
            initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie
            Weizenbaum. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris
            Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a simple
            scripting language used in Sass files. Sass is a preprocessor
            scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading
            Style Sheets (CSS). SassScript is the scripting language itself.
            Sass consists of two syntaxes. The original syntax, called "the
            indented syntax," uses a syntax similar to Haml. It uses indentation
            to separate code blocks and newline characters to separate rules.
            The newer syntax, "SCSS" (Sassy CSS), uses block formatting like
            that of CSS. It uses braces to denote code blocks and semicolons to
            separate lines within a block. The indented syntax and SCSS files
            are traditionally given the extensions .sass and .scss,
            respectively.

            Less (Leaner Style Sheets; sometimes stylized as LESS) is a dynamic
            preprocessor style sheet language that can be compiled into
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and run on the client side or server
            side. Designed by Alexis Sellier, Less is influenced by Sass and has
            influenced the newer "SCSS" syntax of Sass, which adapted its
            CSS-like block formatting syntax. Less is open source. Its first
            version was written in Ruby; however, in the later versions, use of
            Ruby has been deprecated and replaced by JavaScript. The indented
            syntax of Less is a nested metalanguage, as valid CSS is valid Less
            code with the same semantics. Less provides the following
            mechanisms: variables, nesting, mixins, operators and functions; the
            main difference between Less and other CSS precompilers being that
            Less allows real-time compilation via less.js by the browser.

            JavaScript , often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted

            object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and
            CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide

            part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and

            A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in
            JavaScript. It differs from a JavaScript library in its control
            flow: a library offers functions to be called by its parent code,
            whereas a framework defines the entire application design. A
            developer does not call a framework; instead it is the framework
            that will call and use the code in some particular way. Some
            JavaScript frameworks follow the modelâ€“viewâ€“controller paradigm
            designed to segregate a web application into orthogonal units to
            improve code quality and maintainability. Examples: AngularJS,
            Ember.js, Meteor.js.

            A JavaScript library is a library of pre-written JavaScript which
            allows for easier development of JavaScript-based applications,
            especially for AJAX and other web-centric technologies.With the
            expanded demands for JavaScript, an easier means for programmers to
            develop such dynamic interfaces was needed. Thus, JavaScript
            libraries and JavaScript widget libraries were developed, allowing
            for developers to concentrate more upon more distinctive
            applications of Ajax. This has led to other companies and groups,
            such as Microsoft and Yahoo! developing their own JavaScript-based
            user interface libraries, which find their way into the web
            applications developed by these companies. Some JavaScript libraries
            allow for easier integration of JavaScript with other web
            development technologies, such as CSS, PHP, Ruby, and Java. Many
            libraries include code to detect differences between runtime
            environments, and remove the need for applications to allow for such
            inconsistencies. Almost all JavaScript libraries are released under
            either a copycenter or copyleft license to ensure license-free
            distribution, usage, and modification.
